Great question ðŸš€ â€” Python 2.7 (released in 2010, EOL in 2020) and Python 3.12 (released in 2023) are worlds apart. Hereâ€™s a **solid list of 10 key differences** you can confidently bring up in interviews or discussions:

---

## ðŸ”Ÿ Solid Differences Between Python 2.7 and Python 3.12

### 1. **Print Statement vs Print Function**

* **Python 2.7**: `print "Hello"` (statement)
* **Python 3.12**: `print("Hello")` (function, supports advanced features like `sep`, `end`)

---

### 2. **Integer Division**

* **Python 2.7**: `/` does floor division if both operands are integers

  ```python
  print(5 / 2)   # 2
  ```
* **Python 3.12**: `/` always gives float, `//` is floor division

  ```python
  print(5 / 2)   # 2.5
  ```

---

### 3. **Unicode Handling**

* **Python 2.7**: Strings are ASCII by default; Unicode needs `u"hello"`
* **Python 3.12**: Strings are Unicode by default

---

### 4. **Input Function**

* **Python 2.7**: `input()` evaluates input as code; `raw_input()` for plain text
* **Python 3.12**: Only `input()`, always returns a string

---

### 5. **Range / xrange**

* **Python 2.7**: `range()` returns a list, `xrange()` returns a generator-like object
* **Python 3.12**: `range()` returns a lazy, memory-efficient sequence (like `xrange`)

---

### 6. **Exceptions Syntax**

* **Python 2.7**:

  ```python
  except ValueError, e:
      print e
  ```
* **Python 3.12**:

  ```python
  except ValueError as e:
      print(e)
  ```

---

### 7. **Iterators in Built-ins**

* **Python 2.7**:

  * `dict.keys()`, `dict.values()` return lists
* **Python 3.12**:

  * `dict.keys()`, `dict.values()` return *views* (dynamic, memory efficient)

---

### 8. **Libraries & Ecosystem**

* **Python 2.7**: No new features after 2020, ecosystem frozen.
* **Python 3.12**: Active development, modern libraries (asyncio, type hints, dataclasses, pattern matching, etc.)

---

### 9. **Advanced Language Features**

* **Python 2.7**: No support for f-strings, type hints, async/await, data classes, pattern matching.
* **Python 3.12**:

  * f-strings: `f"Hello {name}"`
  * type hints: `def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:`
  * `async`/`await` for concurrency
  * `match` statements (structural pattern matching, introduced in 3.10)

---

### 10. **Performance and Internals**

* **Python 2.7**: Uses legacy CPython interpreter; slower, no modern optimizations.
* **Python 3.12**:

  * Faster CPython with performance improvements (PEP 659 adaptive interpreter, zero-cost exceptions).
  * Better memory management, optimized garbage collector.

---

âœ… **Summary:**
Python 2.7 is **legacy**, with outdated syntax and limitations. Python 3.12 is **modern, faster, safer, and feature-rich**. Migrating is a must for compatibility, performance, and long-term support.

---

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also make you a **table version (Python 2.7 vs 3.12 side-by-side)** so itâ€™s easier to recall quickly in interviews?


Great question ðŸ™Œ â€” Python has a set of **reserved words (keywords)** that you **cannot use as variable names, function names, or identifiers** because they have special meaning in the language.

You can always check the current list in your version of Python with:

```python
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Reserved Words in Python 3.12

(There are **36 keywords** as of Python 3.12)

```
False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Explanation

* **Boolean / Null**: `True`, `False`, `None`
* **Control Flow**: `if`, `else`, `elif`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `return`, `yield`, `try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise`, `assert`
* **Functions & Classes**: `def`, `class`, `lambda`
* **Imports & Modules**: `import`, `from`, `as`
* **Scope & Variables**: `global`, `nonlocal`, `del`
* **Async**: `async`, `await`
* **Operators (logical)**: `and`, `or`, `not`, `is`, `in`
* **Context**: `with`, `pass`

---

âœ… Reserved words are case-sensitive (`True` is a keyword, but `true` is not).
âœ… The set of keywords can slightly differ across Python versions (older versions had `print`, `exec`, etc. as keywords).

Do you want me to also make you a **cheat sheet table (keyword + short meaning)** so itâ€™s easier to memorize for interviews?
